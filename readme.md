# 📘 PAI-Lab

**Price Action Intelligence Laboratory**
*An adaptive trading engine built on Al Brooks' price-action principles*

---

## Overview

PAI-Lab is a modular, multi-asset trading engine that translates Al Brooks' visual price-action methodology into executable, quantifiable code. It detects structural setups (H1, H2, L1, L2, breakouts, wedge reversals), validates them through follow-through bar confirmation, and manages trades with context-aware targets, trailing stops, and partial exits — all gated by an AI probability layer and capital protection system.

**Current performance (BTC 5m backtest):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 155 |
| Win Rate | 60% |
| Expectancy | +0.08 ATR |
| Sharpe Proxy | +0.07 |
| Max Drawdown | −14.2 ATR |

## How It Works

### 1. Signal Detection Pipeline

Every 5-minute candle passes through this pipeline:

```
Candle → Memory Buffer (100 bars)
         ↓
     TrendAnalyzer          → bull/bear/neutral bias
     PriceActionAnalyzer    → bar type, tails, overlap, climactic, inside/outside
     MarketEnvironmentClassifier → structural bull/bear/TTR/trading range
         ↓
     [Block if TTR or climactic exhaustion]
         ↓
     SecondEntryDetector    → H2/L2 explicit two-legged pullback
     FirstEntryDetector     → H1/L1 single-leg (strong trends only, sequence ≥ 3)
     WedgeDetector          → 3-push reversal with decreasing momentum
     BreakoutDetector       → breakout above/below recent range
         ↓
     [Pending Signal → wait for Follow-Through Bar]
         ↓
     Feature Extraction     → 10+ ML features
         ↓
     HOD/LOD Hard Filter    → block buys at session high, sells at session low
         ↓
     AI Probability Gate    → logistic regression with adaptive threshold
         ↓
     Regime & Risk Guards   → statistical and capital protection
         ↓
     Trade Execution
```

### 2. Al Brooks Concepts Implemented

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **H2/L2 (Second Entry)** | Explicit two-legged pullback detector walks backward through Leg 2 → Bounce → Leg 1 → Impulse |
| **H1/L1 (First Entry)** | Single-leg pullback, only in very strong trends (3+ consecutive strong bars) |
| **Wedge / 3-Push Reversal** | Detects 3 pushes to new extremes with decreasing momentum, enters counter-trend |
| **Follow-Through Confirmation** | Signal bars are stored as "pending" — only confirmed if the next bar closes in the signal direction |
| **Signal Bar Quality** | Close position > 0.65 (bull) / < 0.35 (bear), body ratio > 0.4 |
| **Tail Analysis** | Upper/lower tail ratios expose signal weakness |
| **Climactic Exhaustion** | 3+ strong consecutive bars with expanding range suppress entries |
| **Tight Trading Range** | 5+ overlapping doji bars block all signals |
| **Structural Trend** | Half-over-half high/low progression confirms bull/bear structure |
| **Measured Move Targets** | Target = distance of prior impulse leg |
| **HOD/LOD Proximity Filter** | Suppress buys within 0.5 ATR of session high |
| **Inside/Outside Bar** | Detected and flagged in price action output |
| **Breakout Detection** | Range breakouts with strong bar quality act as fallback entries |

### 3. Trade Management (Live Mode)

| Feature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Trailing Stop** | At 0.5× target → stop moves to breakeven. At 1× target → trails behind each new swing |
| **Partial Exit** | 50% taken at 0.5× target distance, 50% rides to full target |
| **Scratch Trade** | If < 30% of target distance after 3 bars → exit at breakeven |
| **Scalp vs Swing** | Context quality score determines target: low quality → 1 ATR scalp, high quality → measured move |
| **Weekend Close** | Flatten positions Friday 16:00 EST for session-based assets |
| **Session Window** | Only detect signals within configured session hours |

### 4. AI Layer

A logistic regression model retrained on a rolling window learns which setups produce winners. It outputs a probability, and trades are filtered by an adaptive threshold optimized on recent expectancy.

**ML Features (10):**
`depth_atr`, `pullback_bars`, `volatility_ratio`, `impulse_size_atr`, `breakout_strength`, `hour`, `dist_to_hod_atr`, `dist_to_lod_atr`, `gap_atr`, `impulse_size_raw`

## Multi-Asset Support

PAI-Lab is designed for multi-asset trading with per-asset configuration:

```python
ASSETS = {
    "BTCUSDT": {
        "session": "24/7",
        "target_mode": "measured_move",
        "close_before_weekend": False
    },
    "XAUUSD": {
        "session": "08:00-17:00_EST",
        "target_mode": "measured_move",
        "close_before_weekend": True
    }
}
```

Each asset gets its own AI model state file (`state/engine_state_BTCUSDT.pkl`), ensuring models trained on BTC never contaminate Gold signals.

## Design Principles

- **No lookahead bias** — all signals are evaluated candle-by-candle
- **No replay stacking** — state manager prevents duplicate processing
- **Follow-through first** — never trade on the signal bar alone
- **Context before mechanics** — structural environment must match the setup direction
- **Capital survival** — risk management is independent of strategy logic
- **Modular isolation** — every component has a single responsibility
